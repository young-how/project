# 地铁路线规划系统(subway_route_plan)
## 介绍(introduce)
###   此项目以北京地铁路线为基础，用佛洛依德算法计算两站点的最短路线，同时对换成时间进行分析，推荐出换成次数最少的乘坐路线。并且输出票价与换成次数。
### This project is based on the Beijing metro line, and uses Freud algorithm to calculate the shortest route between the two stations. At the same time, it analyzes the change time and recommends the route with the least number of changes. And output the ticket price and change times.
### station.txt存放地铁站点信息，分别为(站点编号，站点名称，站点所属路线)，distance.txt存放站点距离，分别为(站点编号1，路线长度，站点编号2)
### station. Txt stores subway station information, which are (station number, station name, station route), distance Txt storage station distance, respectively (Station No. 1, route length, station No. 2)
